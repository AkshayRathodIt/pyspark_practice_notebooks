    "# GlobalTempView in Apache Spark\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In Apache Spark, `GlobalTempView` is a temporary view that is shared among all Spark sessions. It is useful when you want to share a temporary view across different Spark sessions or when you want to run SQL queries across different Spark applications. Unlike regular temporary views (`createOrReplaceTempView`), which are session-scoped, global temporary views are visible across multiple Spark sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### Naming Convention\n",
    "- Use meaningful and descriptive names for global temporary views to avoid confusion.\n",
    "- Prefixing with `global_temp.` can help distinguish global temporary views from session-scoped temporary views.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lifespan Management\n",
    "- Be cautious with global temporary views as they persist beyond the lifespan of a single Spark session.\n",
    "- Explicitly drop global temporary views when they are no longer needed to avoid resource wastage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security Considerations\n",
    "- Ensure that only authorized users and applications have access to create or query global temporary views.\n",
    "- Use Spark's security configurations to control access to global temporary views.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Uses and Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shared Data Exploration\n",
    "- GlobalTempViews facilitate collaborative data exploration across different Spark applications or sessions.\n",
    "- Users can share pre-processed or curated datasets as global temporary views for broader analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross-Application Queries\n",
    "- Enables running SQL queries that span multiple Spark applications, leveraging the same dataset stored in a global temporary view.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize Spark session\n",
    "spark = SparkSession.builder \\\n",
    "    .appName(\"GlobalTempViewExample\") \\\n",
    "    .getOrCreate()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sample data\n",
    "data = [(\"Alice\", 25), (\"Bob\", 30), (\"Carol\", 35)]\n",
    "columns = [\"Name\", \"Age\"]\n",
    "df = spark.createDataFrame(data, columns)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a global temporary view\n",
    "df.createGlobalTempView(\"people\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Query the global temporary view across different sessions\n",
    "# Session 1\n",
    "spark.sql(\"SELECT * FROM global_temp.people\").show()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Session 2 (a new Spark session)\n",
    "spark2 = SparkSession.builder \\\n",
    "    .appName(\"AnotherSession\") \\\n",
    "    .getOrCreate()\n",
    "\n",
    "spark2.sql(\"SELECT * FROM global_temp.people\").show()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Drop the global temporary view when no longer needed\n",
    "spark.catalog.dropGlobalTempView(\"people\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Stop Spark sessions\n",
    "spark.stop()\n",
    "spark2.stop()\n"
